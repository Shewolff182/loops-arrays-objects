/********************** Exercise 5 ***********************/

// Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has 3 properties: title (a string), author (a string), alreadyRead (a boolean to note if you've read it yet).

// Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and its author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".

// Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you've read it yet or not. If you've read it, log a string: 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien'; if not, log a string: 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
